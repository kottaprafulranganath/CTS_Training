using html css and js using ids and functions

 push()  -- pushes the elemetns into the array
 pop()  -- removes the last element at last posiotion
 shift() -- omits the element from the 0-index to variable or cache
 unshift(num) -- add the element into the 0-indexing

 "." is an acess modifier that is used to access elements 
 ex:- in document.getelementbyid the access is in document the function os getelement

 if we use the for loop in js file we cannot print the all element in the array only the last element can be printed.

 "()" this is the operator that calls or invokes functions

 "Objects" are variables that contains many values 
       thse are the name value pairs that are created using curly pairs
       these are also can be implemented using new keyword that create instance 

       Two of the most commonly used JavaScript functions to retrieve elements from a webpage are querySelector() and getElementById().

                     querySelector(): This is used to retrieve an element using a CSS selector. It returns the first element that matches the specified selector.
                     getElementByld(): This function retrieves an element using its ID attribute. It returns the element with the specified ID.
 
 "trim()" is the method that is used to remove space in spentences for example " hello" after using trim() it will be "hello"

 document.createElement('li') ----> create a new element as a list


        # self tasks : 
        To-Do List App
                        Input box to add tasks.
                        Button to add task.
                        Display tasks in a scrollable list.
                        Option to delete tasks.

      The ng-app directive defines an AngularJS application.
      The ng-model directive binds the value of HTML controls (input, select, textarea) to application data.
      The ng-bind directive binds application data to the HTML view
      "$" is used in angular to indicate the special objects

      Warning: The current version of Node (24.1.0) is not supported by Angular.
      PS C:\Users\2430683\Videos\Angular_Practice> ng new my-angular-app
      ? Would you like to add Angular routing? Yes
      ? Which stylesheet format would you like to use? CSS


      we can use npm serve and npm start to run the angular page
      for creating new page use ng appname


      c#
            console.writeLine() in this method the cursor will move to the next line in console.write() the cursor will be in same line the cursor will append the nextline

            Console.WriteLine(0.25F); the "F" is a literal suffix it defines the characters type in this example it is float type "M" is the literal suffix for decimal

            A verbatim string literal will keep all whitespace and characters without the need to escape the backslash. To create a verbatim string, use the @ directive before the literal string.

                  Console.WriteLine(@"    c:\source\repos    );
